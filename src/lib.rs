//! # Biodivine/LibBDD
//!
//! This crate provides a basic implementation of [binary decision diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram) (BDDs) â€” a symbolic data
//! structure for representing Boolean functions or other equivalent objects (such as bit-vector
//! sets).
//!
//! Compared to other popular implementations, every BDD owns its memory. It is thus trivial to
//! serialise, but also to share between threads. This makes it useful for applications that
//! process high number of BDDs concurrently, but is also generally more idiomatic in Rust.
//!
//! At the moment, we support many standard operations on BDDs:
//!
//!  - Any binary logical operation (`and`, `or`, `iff`, ...), and of course negation.
//!  - Evaluation of Boolean expressions parsed from a string.
//!  - A `bdd!` macro for a more idiomatic specification of operation chains.
//!  - Simplified methods for CNF/DNF formula construction.
//!  - Binary and text serialization/deserialization.
//!  - Valuation/path iterators and other `Bdd` introspection methods (`random_valuation`, `most_fixed_clause`, ...).
//!  - Export of `Bdd` back into a Boolean expression.
//!  - "Relational" operations: projection (existential quantification), selection (restriction) and unique subset picking (see tutorials for more info).
//!  - A "variable flip" operation fused with custom logical binary operators.
//!  - Export to `.dot` graphs.
//!
//! More detailed description of all features can be found in our [tutorial module](https://docs.rs/biodivine-lib-bdd/latest/biodivine_lib_bdd/tutorial/index.html), and of course in the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/biodivine-lib-bdd/latest/).
//!
//! ```rust
//! use biodivine_lib_bdd::*;
//!
//! let mut builder = BddVariableSetBuilder::new();
//! let [a, b, c] = builder.make(&["a", "b", "c"]);
//! let variables: BddVariableSet = builder.build();
//!
//! // String expressions:
//! let x = variables.eval_expression_string("(a <=> !b) | c ^ a");
//! // Macro:
//! let y = bdd!(variables, (a <=> (!b)) | (c ^ a));
//! // Logical operators:
//! let z = variables.mk_literal(a, true)
//!     .iff(&variables.mk_literal(b, false))
//!     .or(&variables.mk_literal(c, true).xor(&variables.mk_literal(a, true)));
//!
//! assert!(!x.is_false());
//! assert_eq!(6.0, x.cardinality());
//! assert_eq!(x, y);
//! assert_eq!(y, z);
//! assert_eq!(z, x);
//!
//! for valuation in x.sat_valuations() {
//!     assert!(x.eval_in(&valuation));
//! }
//! ```
